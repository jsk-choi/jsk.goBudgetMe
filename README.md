goBudgetMe - A simple budgeting tool

This is a simple application to test some of the new features in ASP.NET 5, Entity Framework 7, ASP.NET Identity 3, amongst others.

Persist start/end dates across sessions
Repeating transactions (such as future bills/recurring payments)
Mass export/import from spreadsheet files
Friendlier display of debits/credits, instead of negative/positive numbers
Color coding of regular transactions
